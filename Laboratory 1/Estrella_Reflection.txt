The design principles I found most useful were hierarchy and unity, as they helped me organize information clearly and create a visually balanced design. Using hierarchy allowed me to guide the viewer’s attention to the most important details, while unity ensured that all elements worked together harmoniously. The easiest part of using Canva was finding pre-built templates, which made the design process faster and more efficient. However, editing images using Canva’s image editor was the most challenging, as it required more precision and experimentation. Through this activity, I learned that visual communication is a powerful and effective way to introduce myself professionally and leave a strong first impression.
