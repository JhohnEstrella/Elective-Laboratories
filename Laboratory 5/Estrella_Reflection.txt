The purpose of my app, the Student AI Study Companion, is to help students use AI tools in a more responsible way rather than relying on them blindly. It is designed for senior high school and college students who frequently use AI for studying and want a more structured approach to learning. I chose a simple and organized layout to make the app easy to navigate, allowing users to focus on reflection, task management, and critical thinking without distraction. The muted, neutral color palette and clean typography were selected to create a calm and professional interface that supports concentration and readability. One of the main challenges I faced was balancing functionality with simplicity, especially when deciding how much information to display on each screen. With more time, I would improve the interactivity of the usage awareness features to make them more engaging. I would also refine the user flow based on feedback to further enhance usability and learning effectiveness.
